Given the previous movement pattern and road infrastructure, the most logical continuation would be to maintain the same direction and speed along the same road.\n\n7. The movement appears to be during smooth traffic conditions as the distances covered in each interval are consistent.\n\n8. The area being traversed seems to be a less densely built-up section of the city, which supports the possibility of maintaining consistent speed and direction.\n\n9. If we project the same movement pattern forward, it would continue westward along the same road.\n\n10.
