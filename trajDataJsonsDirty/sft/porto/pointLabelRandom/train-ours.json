In the format like <|object_ref_start|>the 1th point<|object_ref_end|><|box_start|>(749,500),(750,501)<|box_end|>\n",
        "solution": "<answer>\n<|object_ref_start|>the 1th point<|object_ref_end|><|box_start|>(114,731),(115,732)<|box_end|>\n</answer>\n",
        "answer": "<|object_ref_start|>the 1th point<|object_ref_end|><|box_start|>(114,731),(115,732)<|box_end|>\n"
    }
