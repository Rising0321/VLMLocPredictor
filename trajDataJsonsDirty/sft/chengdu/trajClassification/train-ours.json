Movement Momentum:\n- The recent trajectory shows a clear southward trend\n- The last few arrows indicate a pattern of following the main road\n- There's no indication of a sudden direction change\n5.

Considering the road network:\n   - The taxi is currently on what appears to be a main road\n   - The road continues in the <|box_start|>(0,0),(499,1000)<|box_end|> region\n   - There are multiple road options available in the <|box_start|>(0,0),(499,1000)<|box_end|> region\n   - The road structure supports continued movement in the same direction\n4.
